This repository assumes a version of conda is installed on your system.
E.g. you may use miniforge, located here: https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge

It also assumes you have the `poetry` package manager installed.
See install here:  https://python-poetry.org/docs/

To set up the environment, you can run:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

To activate the environment, run:

```bash
conda activate gnss_lectures
```

To install the package in editable mode, run:

```bash
poetry install
```

You can add your own utilities/functions to the `utils/` folder as needed.

Please email me if you have any problems, and I will do my best to help!
If you need PDF versions of the solution notebooks, I can try to provide those as well.
